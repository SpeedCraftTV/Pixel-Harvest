# Multiplayer Module

## Overview
This module implements real-time multiplayer functionality for Pixel-Harvest, enabling cooperative and competitive farming experiences. Related to [Issue #24](https://github.com/SpeedCraftTV/Pixel-Harvest/issues/24).

## Module Responsibilities
- **WebSocket Communication**: Real-time bidirectional communication with game server
- **Room Management**: Create, join, and manage multiplayer game sessions
- **State Synchronization**: Keep all players' game states synchronized
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle simultaneous actions on the same resources
- **Player Management**: Track player positions, actions, and inventory
- **Lobby System**: Browse and join available game rooms

## Integration Points

### Main Game Loop Integration
```javascript
// In main game update loop
if (MultiplayerModule.isEnabled()) {
    MultiplayerModule.update(deltaTime);
    MultiplayerModule.syncPlayerState(player);
}
```

### Event System Hooks
- `player.move` → Broadcast position updates
- `player.plant` → Sync plot changes
- `player.harvest` → Update shared farm state
- `player.chat` → Send messages to room

### Index.html Integration
```html
<!-- Add to UI panels -->
<div id="multiplayerPanel" style="display: none;">
    <div id="roomBrowser"></div>
    <div id="playerList"></div>
    <div id="chatWindow"></div>
</div>
```

## API Interface

### Core Functions
```javascript
// Initialize multiplayer system
MultiplayerModule.init(gameConfig);

// Room operations
MultiplayerModule.createRoom(roomOptions);
MultiplayerModule.joinRoom(roomId, playerData);
MultiplayerModule.leaveRoom();

// Communication
MultiplayerModule.sendAction(actionType, actionData);
MultiplayerModule.broadcastState(gameState);

// Event handling
MultiplayerModule.on('playerJoined', (player) => {});
MultiplayerModule.on('stateUpdate', (gameState) => {});
```

## Example TODOs and Tasks

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
- [ ] **Setup WebSocket Connection**
  - Implement connection management with automatic reconnection
  - Handle connection states (connecting, connected, disconnected)
  - Add ping/pong for connection health monitoring

- [ ] **Basic Room System**
  - Create room creation and joining functionality
  - Implement room browser with filters (public/private, game mode)
  - Add room capacity management and player limits

- [ ] **Player State Sync**
  - Synchronize player positions across clients
  - Handle player avatars and appearance
  - Implement basic player list display

### Phase 2: Game Integration (Week 3-4)
- [ ] **Farming Actions Sync**
  - Synchronize planting actions across players
  - Handle harvesting with conflict resolution
  - Sync watering and tool usage

- [ ] **Shared Farm State**
  - Implement plot ownership or sharing system
  - Synchronize crop growth and weather effects
  - Handle farm decorations and customizations

- [ ] **Chat and Communication**
  - Add text chat with emoji support
  - Implement quick reactions and gestures
  - Add communication moderation features

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 5-6)
- [ ] **Competitive Modes**
  - Implement timed farming challenges
  - Add scoring and leaderboard systems
  - Create harvest competitions and races

- [ ] **Cooperative Features**
  - Add shared inventory and resource pooling
  - Implement collaborative building projects
  - Create team objectives and goals

- [ ] **Performance Optimization**
  - Implement delta compression for state updates
  - Add client-side prediction for smooth movement
  - Optimize bandwidth usage for mobile devices

## Data Models

### Player Network State
```javascript
{
    playerId: 'uuid',
    name: 'string',
    position: { x: number, y: number, z: number },
    avatar: { /* customization data */ },
    currentAction: 'idle|walking|planting|harvesting',
    inventory: { /* player inventory */ },
    lastUpdate: timestamp
}
```

### Room Configuration
```javascript
{
    roomId: 'uuid',
    name: 'string',
    gameMode: 'cooperative|competitive|free_play',
    maxPlayers: number,
    isPublic: boolean,
    settings: {
        allowChat: boolean,
        sharedInventory: boolean,
        timeLimit: number
    }
}
```

## Performance Considerations
- **Network Optimization**: Use delta compression and batch updates
- **Client Prediction**: Implement prediction for responsive movement
- **Memory Management**: Clean up disconnected players promptly
- **Mobile Support**: Optimize for limited bandwidth and battery life

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Connection stability under network issues
- [ ] State synchronization accuracy with multiple players
- [ ] Performance with maximum number of players (8)
- [ ] Mobile device compatibility and performance
- [ ] Cross-browser WebSocket support

## Dependencies
- WebSocket API (native browser support)
- Game state management system
- Player authentication system
- Error handling and logging utilities

## Configuration
```javascript
// Feature flag in data/features.json
{
    "multiplayer": {
        "enabled": false,
        "version": "0.1.0",
        "config": {
            "maxRooms": 100,
            "maxPlayersPerRoom": 8,
            "heartbeatInterval": 30000,
            "reconnectAttempts": 3
        }
    }
}
```
