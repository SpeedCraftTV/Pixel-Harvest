# Multiplayer Module

## Overview
This module implements real-time multiplayer functionality for Pixel-Harvest, enabling cooperative and competitive farming experiences. Related to [Issue #24](https://github.com/SpeedCraftTV/Pixel-Harvest/issues/24).

## Module Responsibilities
- **WebSocket Communication**: Real-time bidirectional communication with game server
- **Room Management**: Create, join, and manage multiplayer game sessions
- **State Synchronization**: Keep all players' game states synchronized
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle simultaneous actions on the same resources
- **Player Management**: Track player positions, actions, and inventory
- **Lobby System**: Browse and join available game rooms

## Integration Points

### Main Game Loop Integration
```javascript
// In main game update loop
if (MultiplayerModule.isEnabled()) {
    MultiplayerModule.update(deltaTime);
    MultiplayerModule.syncPlayerState(player);
}
```

### Event System Hooks
- `player.move` → Broadcast position updates
- `player.plant` → Sync plot changes
- `player.harvest` → Update shared farm state
- `player.chat` → Send messages to room

### Index.html Integration
```html
<!-- Add to UI panels -->
<div id="multiplayerPanel" style="display: none;">
    <div id="roomBrowser"></div>
    <div id="playerList"></div>
    <div id="chatWindow"></div>
</div>
```

## API Interface

### Core Functions
```javascript
// Initialize multiplayer system
MultiplayerModule.init(gameConfig);

// Room operations
MultiplayerModule.createRoom(roomOptions);
MultiplayerModule.joinRoom(roomId, playerData);
MultiplayerModule.leaveRoom();

// Communication
MultiplayerModule.sendAction(actionType, actionData);

```

### Runtime Configuration API
```javascript
// Dynamic configuration updates
MultiplayerModule.updateConfig({
    "stateSyncInterval": 50, // Increase frequency for competitive mode
    "compressionEnabled": false, // Disable for debugging
    "debugMode": true // Enable debug logging
});

// Feature toggle API
MultiplayerModule.toggleFeature('competitiveModeEnabled', true);
MultiplayerModule.toggleFeature('chatEnabled', false);

// Performance adaptation
MultiplayerModule.adaptToDevice({
    isMobile: true,
    connectionQuality: 'poor',
    batteryLevel: 'low'
});
```

## Technical Implementation Guidelines

### Architecture Patterns
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Use event emitters for loose coupling between components
- **Observer Pattern**: Implement observers for state change notifications
- **Command Pattern**: Encapsulate multiplayer actions as command objects
- **State Machine**: Manage connection states and game states with finite state machines
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstract data access for player and room information

### Performance Optimization Guidelines
- **Message Batching**: Combine multiple small messages into single transmissions
- **Delta Compression**: Only send changed data, not full state snapshots
- **Client Prediction**: Predict action outcomes to reduce perceived latency
- **Interpolation**: Smooth movement between network updates
- **Culling**: Only sync relevant data based on player proximity and interest
- **Adaptive Quality**: Adjust sync frequency based on connection quality
- **Memory Management**: Implement proper cleanup for disconnected players
- **Asset Caching**: Cache frequently used multiplayer assets locally

### Security Best Practices
- **Input Validation**: Validate all client inputs on both client and server
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent spam and abuse with configurable rate limits
- **Authentication**: Verify player identity for all multiplayer actions
- **Authorization**: Check permissions before allowing actions
- **Data Sanitization**: Clean user-generated content before distribution
- **Audit Logging**: Log all significant multiplayer events for security review
- **Encryption**: Use secure communication channels (WSS) in production
- **Anti-Cheat**: Implement server-side validation for all game actions

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue functioning with reduced features during issues
- **Automatic Recovery**: Attempt to recover from common error conditions
- **User Communication**: Provide clear, actionable error messages to users
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Provide offline or single-player alternatives
- **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascading failures with circuit breaker patterns
- **Retry Logic**: Implement intelligent retry mechanisms with backoff

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions and data flow
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user workflows
- **Load Testing**: Verify performance under expected user loads
- **Stress Testing**: Test behavior beyond normal operating conditions
- **Security Testing**: Verify security measures and vulnerability management
- **Compatibility Testing**: Ensure cross-browser and cross-device compatibility
- **Usability Testing**: Validate user experience with real users
