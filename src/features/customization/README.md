## Data Models

### Character Appearance
```javascript
{
    playerId: 'uuid',
    appearance: {
        skin: {
            tone: 'light|medium|dark|custom',
            color: '#RGB'
        },
        hair: {
            style: 'short_brown|long_blonde|curly_black|bald',
            color: '#RGB'
        },
        clothing: {
            top: 'shirt_red|overalls_blue|dress_green',
            bottom: 'pants_brown|skirt_purple',
            shoes: 'boots_brown|sneakers_white',
            accessories: ['straw_hat', 'work_gloves']
        }
    },
    unlockedItems: [
        'shirt_red', 'overalls_blue', 'straw_hat'
    ],
    favoriteOutfits: [
        {
            name: 'Work Outfit',
            items: ['overalls_blue', 'boots_brown', 'straw_hat']
        }
    ]
}
```

### Farm Decoration
```javascript
{
    farmId: 'uuid',
    layout: {
        theme: 'rustic',
        backgroundColor: '#87CEEB',
        decorations: [
            {
                id: 'decoration_001',
                assetId: 'red_barn',
                position: { x: 10, y: 0, z: 5 },
                rotation: 90,
                scale: 1.0,
                layer: 1
            }
        ],
        paths: [
            {
                points: [{ x: 0, z: 0 }, { x: 5, z: 5 }],
                material: 'stone_path',
                width: 1.0
            }
        ],
        boundaries: [
            {
                type: 'fence',
                material: 'wood_fence',
                points: [{ x: -15, z: -15 }, { x: 15, z: 15 }]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

### Customization Asset
```javascript
{
    assetId: 'red_barn',
    name: 'Red Barn',
    category: 'building',
    subcategory: 'storage',
    rarity: 'common',
    unlockRequirements: {
        level: 10,
        coins: 1000,
        achievements: ['first_harvest'],
        seasonalEvent: null
    },
    properties: {
        functional: false,
        size: { width: 4, height: 3, depth: 3 },
        collisionBox: { width: 4, depth: 3 },
        snapToGrid: true,
        allowRotation: true,
        allowScaling: false
    },
    rendering: {
        modelPath: 'assets/models/red_barn.obj',
        texturePath: 'assets/textures/red_barn.png',
        normalMapPath: 'assets/textures/red_barn_normal.png',
        lodLevels: [
            { distance: 20, model: 'red_barn_high.obj' },
            { distance: 50, model: 'red_barn_medium.obj' },
            { distance: 100, model: 'red_barn_low.obj' }
        ]
    },
    tags: ['rustic', 'storage', 'large', 'seasonal_autumn']
}
```

## Performance Considerations
- **Asset Loading**: Lazy load customization assets, use texture atlases
- **LOD System**: Multiple detail levels for decorations based on distance
- **Culling**: Hide decorations outside camera view
- **Memory Management**: Unload unused assets, pool decoration objects
- **Mobile Optimization**: Reduced detail modes for mobile devices

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Character customizations save and load correctly
- [ ] Farm decorations render properly in 3D space
- [ ] Placement system works accurately with collision detection
- [ ] Unlock system integrates with progression properly
- [ ] Performance remains stable with many decorations
- [ ] Mobile interface is touch-friendly and responsive

## Dependencies
- 3D rendering system for decoration display
- Save/load system for persistence
- Asset loading system for customization content
- UI framework for customization interface
- Achievement system for unlock conditions

## Configuration
```javascript
// Feature flag in data/features.json
{
    "customization": {
        "enabled": true,
        "version": "0.8.0",
        "config": {
            "maxDecorations": 100,
            "assetQuality": "medium",
            "enableAdvancedEditing": true,
            "allowCustomColors": true,
            "socialFeatures": false
        }
    }
}
```

## Integration with Other Modules
- **Multiplayer Module**: Sync customizations across players
- **Seasons Module**: Seasonal decorations and themes
- **Quests Module**: Customization rewards from quest completion
- **Animals Module**: Animal-themed decorations and accessories

## Accessibility Considerations
- **Color Blind Support**: Alternative indicators beyond color
- **Motor Impairment**: Keyboard navigation for all customization features
- **Screen Readers**: Proper ARIA labels for customization options
- **Touch Accessibility**: Large touch targets, gesture alternatives
