## Contributing Guidelines

### Getting Started
1. Review the [design specifications](design/FEATURE-SPECS.md)
2. Check feature flags in `data/features.json`
3. Choose a feature module in `src/features/`
4. Follow the PR template guidelines

### Development Workflow
1. **Create Feature Branch**: `feature/[module]-[specific-feature]`
2. **Implement**: Follow module-specific guidelines in feature README files
3. **Test**: Ensure existing functionality remains intact
4. **Document**: Update relevant specifications and documentation
5. **PR Review**: Use the provided PR template

### Code Guidelines
- **No Breaking Changes**: Preserve existing game functionality
- **Feature Flags**: New features must be toggleable
- **Modular Design**: Keep features loosely coupled
- **Performance**: Consider mobile and low-end device support
- **Accessibility**: Maintain keyboard and mobile touch support

## Dependencies and Technical Requirements

### Current Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML5, Canvas API, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Rendering**: Custom 3D engine with 2D canvas
- **Storage**: localStorage for game state
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages (static hosting)

### New Dependencies (Proposed)
- **WebSocket Library**: For real-time multiplayer
- **State Management**: For complex feature interactions
